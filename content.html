            That's right, folks—Auckland is officially the best place to live in
            2021. While the city is often (mistakenly) used as little more than
            a transit stop en route to Queensland, a slew of new urban renewal
            projects are making us all consider a permanent relocation.
            Once-neglected sections of the city's waterfront are being
            transformed into buzzing areas filled with green spaces and notable
            shopping addresses. Even before all of these changes, Auckland has
            long held a reputation for being a popular spot for expats—in fact,
            some 40 percent of its population was born overseas. Beyond having
            beautiful places to hike, sail, and surf within easy reach, the city
            has a diverse culinary scene to match its worldly population.
